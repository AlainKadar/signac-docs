Contribute
==========

Contributions to **signac** are very welcome!
We highly appreciate contributions in the form of general **user feedback** and **bug reports** on the `gitter channel <https://gitter.im/signac/Lobby>`_, the `issue tracker <https://bitbucket.org/glotzer/signac/issues>`_, or via `email <mailto:signac-support@umichedu>`_.

Developers are invited to contribute to any of the packages via pull requests!
It is recommended to discuss new features in form of a proposal on the `issue tracker <https://bitbucket.org/glotzer/signac/issues>`_ prior to development.

The source code for all packages is hosted on bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/account/user/glotzer/projects/SIG.

All code contributed via pull request needs to adhere to the following guidelines:

  1. Most signac packages follow the git-flow branching model. Bug fixes should be implemented in a branch based on ``master``, new features should be developed within a branch based on ``develop``.
  2. All code needs to adhere to the PEP8 style guide, with the exception that a line may have up to 100 characters.
  3. New features must be proplerly documented and tested with automated unit tests.
  4. Non-obvious code passages should be extensively documented.
  5. Changes must generally be backwards-compatible.

.. note::

    Please see the individual package documentation for detailed guidelines on how to contribute to a specific package.
